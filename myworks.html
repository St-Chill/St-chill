        <p>During my free time I have started a part time hobby of creating custom 3D models, novelties and decorations made out of plastic. These made from the ground up by using 
        a 3d printer. All models are made to order and there is are infinite possibilities ranging from figurines, personalized gifts, accessories and even car parts. Contact me via whatsapp or
        any other link to discuss your idea for your your own 3D model which will be painted, glossed and finished. The possibilities are endless. Below is a selection of a few of my finished moulds.</p>

        <p> Almost identical to the actual movie prop, This is a replica of Loki's mask from the 1999 film <br> mask
            starring Jim carrey. It makes a great room ornament and also a great costume. </p>

            <h2> Detailed Gremiln Bust</h2>

        

            <p> This is one of my more detailed designs. It was custom made for the DJ Gremlin for his apperance on Goodhope FM's 50th year anniversary
                where he displayed it on his turntables during his virtual performance.
